# International Space Station Tracker 🌌
Python code 🤖 that tracks where is the International Space Station (ISS) 🚀 currently at the sky. When the ISS is right above our location, we're going to send ourselves an email telling us to look up at the sky! 🌌

## What is the International Space Station? 🤔
The International Space Station (ISS) is a modular space station (habitable artificial satellite) in low Earth orbit. It is a multinational collaborative project involving five participating space agencies: NASA (United States), Roscosmos (Russia), JAXA (Japan), ESA (Europe), and CSA (Canada).

## What does the code does? 🤯
The code will run automatically every 3 minutes, and if the ISS is near you it will email you to the email of your choice, letting you know the ISS is near!
